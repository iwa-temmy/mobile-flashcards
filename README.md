# Mobile-flashcards Project

This is an exercise for the final assessment project for Udacity's React Fundamentals course. The sole purpose of the app is to test my knowlege on react-native.

This app was bootstrapped with CRNA - Create-react-native-app

To get started developing right away:

- install all project dependencies with `npm install`
- start the development server with `yarn web`
